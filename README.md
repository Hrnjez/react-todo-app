# Create React App

Basic React project with a focus on practising state, props, hooks and wokring with an API.

## Start the app step by step.
1. Download the project
2. `npm install` to install node_modules
3. `npm start` to start the app
4. Open another terminal and type `npm run server`. 

That way you will open a demo server and get a full fake rest api, json-server is a node module that you can use to create a demo rest json web service.
